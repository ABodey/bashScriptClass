# Reasons for taking the class
- Sometimes an app or the graphical Gnome desktop will “freeze up”, and you can use the CL to kill the frozen app, restart the Gnome desktop, or even reboot your computer.
- Some linux computers don’t even run a graphical desktop environment, and everything is done with the CL. Many web app servers and database servers running Linux will not have a graphical desktop installed or running (this helps free up resources - memory).
- If you want to be a Linux server and/or network administrator, then you will need to have good CL skills.
- Some things are done faster in the CL than the graphical Gnome desktop.
- You can really impress that hot nerdy girl or guy with your geeky CL skills!
